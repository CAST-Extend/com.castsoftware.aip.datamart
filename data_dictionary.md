### APP_VIOLATIONS_EVOLUTION
Added and removed violation numbers by application snapshot, by technology, by rule. We extract measures for rules that are still active in the latest snapshot of each application. If for some reasons a rule has been deactivated or detached for an application, no measure are extracted for this application. Some rules may be not reported if both nb_added_violations and nb_removed_violations equal zero.

* in case of a data extraction from a measurement base, the measurement base must be __8.3.5__ or higher 

This view can be customized in order to extend the columns, by editing the SQL script: ```views/DIM_QUALITY_STANDARDS.sql```
See the STD_DESCRIPTIONS and STD_RULES tables to get the available quality standard tags.
By default the following BOOLEAN columns are defined:

### DIM_SNAPSHOTS
A Dimension table to filter measures according to a period. 
* Column YEAR, YEAR_MONTH, YEAR_QUARTER, YEAR_WEEK are set only for the most recent snapshot of this period for this application; they are provided to filter snapshots for a specific period
* These columns make sense when applications are periodically analyzed. For instance, if each application is analyzed once a year, then we can use the column YEAR as a filter; if some applications are not analyzed every week; then the YEAR_WEEK filter must be used carefully.

### MOD_VIOLATIONS_EVOLUTION
Added and removed violation numbers by snapshot, by module, by technology, by rule. We extract measures for rules that are still active in the latest snapshot of each application. If for some reasons a rule has been deactivated or detached for an application, no measure are extracted for this application. Some rules may be not reported if both nb_added_violations and nb_removed_violations equal zero.
